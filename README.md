# population_model
I'm playing with variations on the Ricker model of population dynamics, given by the equation

N_t+1 = N_t * exp(r * (1 - N_t/K))

where N is the population, r is the reproductive rate (or 'biotic potential'), and K is the equilibrium population, also called the carrying capacity of the environment.
